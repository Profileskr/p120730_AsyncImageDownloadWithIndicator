##Image Async Download with Animation GIF

This sample project shows async download image from Flickr (free to change the URL). While downloading image, this app shows animation gif image like activity indicator.

I used two libraries.

- AFNetworking

  <https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking>

- LBGifImage

Please pay attention to put the framework `ImageIO.framework` into your project.
